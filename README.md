##  About Me

Hi there!

I am a recent graduate with a Master of Science in Health Information Technology from the University of Michigan-Dearborn, eager to kickstart my career in Information Technology. While I am just starting my professional journey, I am excited to contribute my skills and learn from experienced professionals in a dynamic IT environment. 

This GitHub portfolio is a showcase of my personal projects, where I've applied my skills to solve real-world problems and explore new technologies. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to connect!
